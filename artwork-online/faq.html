                <h2>Who can be a part of algorithmic art?</h2>
                <p>Anyone can do algorithmic art. It all depends on what you do with the programs. If one creates the code, the style and all the effort that is put into the code itself is art. How all the different sequences and lines connect and correlate together is what makes it art. Another way one can create art using algorithms is inputting the parameters. The method used to make all the art different is the parameters. With this, one could state if they want to make a castle, a spaceship, grassy hills, or even a skyscraper images. There are so many different ways this art can be created. With this option, it gives anyone the capability to have the opportunity to take a part in the artistic world and have a touch of creativity in their life.</p>

                <h2>Why create art through algorithms if there is no emotion in the art?</h2>            
                <p>This has a lot of debate in the programing and artistic worlds. Artists create art using their emotion. Most artists will say when they create their artwork, they use emotion to describe their art piece. A great example of this is Pablo Picasso. There was a period of time where he was battling depression (blue period). He was able to convey this through his art. Unlike common art we see with emotion, AI art is just a program, not someone using emotion to create an art piece. However, the thought comes to mind that all art can be seen in different ways. The one who input the parameters, or wrote the code, had to use their creative mind to decide on what to implement or how to run the program.</p>

                <h2>Isn't it just fake art?</h2>
                <p>Art can be defined as something created with imagination and skill and that is beautiful. When creating an art piece, the artists use their skills and imagination to create what they are imagining. On the other hand, the AI code is just generating the art randomly with no emotion. However, there is one aspect people tend to skip over. Someone had to create the code that was used to generate the art. The programmers used their skills and imagination to design and program the code to run and generate art pieces within seconds.</p>

                <h2>Will algorithmic art take away real artist's jobs?</h2>
                <p>In short, the answer is no. There is a difference between an artist and an algorist. An artist uses emotion to create their art while an algorist uses a program. There is a lot of imagination and skill used to create the program, but most of the time there is an absence of emotion. Many people who buy art would rather go for the artwork that had emotion and purpose when being designed and created. In addition, most art pieces created by people tend to be more difficult to make when AI art is easy as typing in a few words or phrases. To summarize, art created by people is higher quality, harder to come by, and can be more physical. On the other hand, AI art is digital only and is much easier to make and come by.</p>
