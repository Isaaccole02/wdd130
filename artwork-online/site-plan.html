      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the website is to share different images, pictures, artwork that can be
        created by an autonomous AI art creator. With advances in technology and artifical 
        intelligence, there has been a large varriety of different functions the AI can accomplish. 
        On this website, we will have the main focus on art what the AI artificaly created.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience of this website are tech lovers and artists. It will have some information on
        how the AI works and also display the different art that it can create. This will help the
        audience see how AI is making an impact on the world.

        <b>What comes to mind?</b>
        <br>
        When you think of art, what comes to mind when thinking about it? You might imagine a variety of colors on a white canvas. One could imagine classic art pieces like the Mona Lisa or Vango's Stary Night. One could also imagine a little kid drawing a family of stick figures with a stick figure dog. Now, what comes to mind when algorithms pop into the phrase? Some might think coding. Other might think technology and think about their phones and computers.
        <br>
        <b>What is algorithmic art?</b>
        <br>
        Algorithmic art is art designed and generated by an algorithm. Also know as computer generated art. When it could take a person days or even months to create just one piece of art, it takes a computer less than one minute to design and create multiple pieces of digital art. Just like how artists create paintings, those who create the code or give parameters to the algorithm are called algorists (digital artists). These algorists can either create their own algorithms to run and create the art. Or one could place the parameters on already created code. An algorist can be someone who creates the code or places the parameters. Just like how there is many different types of artists, an algorist could be someone who programs and creates art. Or they could be someone who designs and creates the art. 
        <br>
        <b>Where did it come from?</b>
        <br>
        The history of algorithmic art begins all the way in the 1960s. This is the same time when developments in computer technology was on the rise. The first algorithmic art was made possible by programable plotter machines. This was a type of printer that took the program created by the user and during this time it created geometric patterns. From there, programmers went further and created geometric algorithms.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        <b>With new ideas and new topics, there is always a variety of questions. Here are some questions related to Algorithmic art. </b>
        <br>
        <b>Who can do algorithmic art? </b>
        <br>
        Anyone can do algorithmic art. It all depends on what you do with the programs. If one creates the code, the style and all the effort that is put into the code itself is art. How all the different sequences and lines connect and correlate together is what makes it art. Another way one can create art using algorithms is inputting the parameters. The method used to make all the art different is the parameters. With this, one could state if they want to make a castle, a spaceship, grassy hills, or even a skyscraper images. There are so many different ways this art can be created. With this option, it gives anyone the capability to have the opportunity to take a part in the artistic world and have a touch of creativity in their life. 
        <br>
        <b>Why create art through algorithms if there is no emotion in the art?</b>
        <br>
        This has a lot of debate in the programing and artistic worlds. Artists create art using their emotion. Most artists will say when they create their artwork, they use emotion to describe their art piece. A great example of this is Pablo Picasso. There was a period of time where he was battling depression (blue period). He was able to convey this through his art. Unlike common art we see with emotion, AI art is just a program, not someone using emotion to create an art piece. However, the thought comes to mind that all art can be seen in different ways. The one who input the parameters, or wrote the code, had to use their creative mind to decide on what to implement or how to run the program. 
        <br>
        <b>Isn't just fake art?</b>
        <br>
        Art can be defined as something created with imagination and skill and that is beautiful. When creating an art piece, the artists use their skills and imagination to create what they are imagining. On the other hand, the AI code is just generating the art randomly with no emotion. However, there is one aspect people tend to skip over. Someone had to create the code that was used to generate the art. The programmers used their skills and imagination to design and program the code to run and generate art pieces within seconds. 
        <br>
        <b>Will algorithmic art take away real artist's jobs?</b>
        <br>
        In short, the answer is no. There is a difference between an artist and an algorist. An artist uses emotion to create their art while an algorist uses a program. There is a lot of imagination and skill used to create the program, but most of the time there is an absence of emotion. Many people who buy art would rather go for the artwork that had emotion and purpose when being designed and created. In addition, most art pieces created by people tend to be more difficult to make when AI art is easy as typing in a few words or phrases. To summarize, art created by people is higher quality, harder to come by, and can be more physical. On the other hand, AI art is digital only and is much easier to make and come by.
