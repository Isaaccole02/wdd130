                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>When you think of art, what comes to mind when thinking about it? You might imagine a variety of colors on a white canvas. One could imagine classic art pieces like the Mona Lisa or Vango's Stary Night. One could also imagine a little kid drawing a family of stick figures with a stick figure dog. Now, what comes to mind when algorithms pop into the phrase? Some might think coding. Other might think technology and think about their phones and computers.</p>

                    <h2>Lets talk about Algorithmic Art</h2>
                    <p>Algorithmic art is art designed and generated by an algorithm. Also know as computer generated art. When it could take a person days or even months to create just one piece of art, it takes a computer less than one minute to design and create multiple pieces of digital art. Just like how artists create paintings, those who create the code or give parameters to the algorithm are called algorists (digital artists). These algorists can either create their own algorithms to run and create the art. Or one could place the parameters on already created code. An algorist can be someone who creates the code or places the parameters. Just like how there is many different types of artists, an algorist could be someone who programs and creates art. Or they could be someone who designs and creates the art.</p>

                    <h2>Brief History</h2>
                    <p>The history of algorithmic art begins all the way in the 1960s. This is the same time when developments in computer technology was on the rise. The first algorithmic art was made possible by programable plotter machines. This was a type of printer that took the program created by the user and during this time it created geometric patterns. From there, programmers went further and created geometric algorithms.</p>
