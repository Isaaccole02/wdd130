    <h2>Isaac James Cole</h2>
    <h2>I do not have a nickname, but at my work they call me Iron Man!</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of interests in the different types of career paths
        that I can take. The difficult part is making the decision. I
        am currently in Business managment operations. I also am very 
        interested in Automotive Engineering, education, and Web design
        and development.</p>
    <p>I am not married yet, I still plan to serve a mission for the
        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, so I will be working
        on that later. I do however, have a awesome mother, father, one 
        older brother, two older sisters, one younger sister, one brother 
        and sister married in, and a little nephew that means so much to
        me. I have to say, he is pretty cute for a baby.</p>
    <p>One thing that I really love about BYU-Idaho is how they are able
        to teach acedemics and corrilate the spirit into their classes.
        Compared to other colleges and schools, BYU-Idaho really brings a 
        different feeling into their classes. </p>
